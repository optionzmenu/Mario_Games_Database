# Mario_Games_Database
A python script that scraps a Mario wiki (https://nintendo.fandom.com/wiki/List_of_Mario_games) of every Mario game created and categorizes them into a simple database. Tables are console names with games and year having their own column and rows.

Utilizes BeautifulSoup and SQLite3 to accomplish this.
